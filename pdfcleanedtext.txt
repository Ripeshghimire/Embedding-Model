financial markets is a marketplace where creation and trading of financial assets like shares debentures bonds derivatives currencies and so forth takes place it plays very important role in allocating scarce resources in the economy of the country the financial markets can be broadly classified into i money markets and ii capital markets as in figure figure money markets money markets is a market for debt securities that pay off in the shortterm usually less than one year for instance the market for days treasury bills this market encompasses the issuance and trading of shortterm nonequity debt instruments including treasury bills commercial papers bankers acceptance certificates of deposits etc capital markets capital markets is a market for longterm debt and equity shares usually for more than one year in this market the capital funds comprising both equity and debt are issued and traded this includes both private placement sources of debt and equity as well as organised markets like stock exchanges securities markets it is composed of two terms securities and markets referring financial instruments issued to raise funds and a place or places where securities are bought and sold respectively it provides facilities and people engaged in such transactions the demand for and availability of securities to be traded and the willingness of buyers and sellers to reach agreement on sales secondary markets include overthecounter markets and stock exchange the primary function of the securities markets is to enable to flow of capital from those that have it to those that need it securities market helps in transfer of resources from those with idle resources to others who have a productive need for them securities markets provide channels for allocation of savings to investments and thereby decouple these two activities as a result the savers and investors are not constrained by their individual abilities but by the economys abilities to invest and save respectively which inevitably enhances savings and investment in the economyinvestors handbook securities markets can be further divided into the i primary market and ii secondary market primary market a market where securities are directly offered to the general public by a company or issuer with the help of merchant bank as an intermediary who acts as an expert of issue management on behalf of the issuer the issue management is done by issue manager under merchant banking function licensed by the securities board of nepal sebon secondary market a market where securities both equity and debt are traded after being initially offered to the public in the primary market and listed at the stock exchanges trading of listed securities take place in the secondary market for a company secondary equity markets serve as a monitoring and control conduitby facilitating valueenhancing control activities enabling implementation of incentivebased management contracts and aggregating information via price discovery that guides the management decisions for an investor the secondary market provides an efficient platform for trading as well as liquidity of his investment made in securities over the counter market is one of segments of secondary market nonlisted along with delisted securities of public limited companies can be traded on otc market platform provided by the nepse normally without the involvement of market intermediaries it is offexchange trading of sharesdesirable characteristic of financial markets i market efficiency ii market depth and iii market width are prerequisite of financial market these factors are the desirable characteristics of financial market market efficiency the primary market provides an intermediary function by channeling funds from investors with savings to firms and businesses that are seeking funds for investments secondary markets on the other hand reinforce the primary market by providing the flexibility for investors to liquidate their holdings when desired financial markets also perform an allocative function by directing investor savings to business and investments with the highest returns firms and businesses that are efficiently operated and are able to identify superior investment opportunities will command higher prices for their securities and will attract the needed capital resources thus will flow to the best uses in the economy however this depends on whether the market is efficient in the sense that whether stock prices accurately reflect the expectations about companies performance markets are usually classified under one of three levels of efficiency i weak ii semi strong and iii strong in the weak form efficient market stock prices are assumed to reflect all past information including price and volume information which means that abnormal profits cannot be mode of trading based on historical i nformation investors handbook the market reflects all publicly available information in the semi strong form efficient markets while reflecting all information whether public or nonpublic in security prices in the semi strong form investors cannot make abnormal profits using publicly available information and not even inside information if the market is efficient at the strong from level in addition to efficiency liquidity is another desirable property in a market liquidity enables an investor to sell a security quickly and easily at a fair price money market securities such as government treasury bills tend to be very liquid while real estate assets are typically illiquid market participants are willing to pay a premium for securities that are liquid and inflict a discount on securities that are illiquid the liquidity of a security is particularly affected by i market depth and ii market width market depth the market for a security is said to have depth if there are plenty of buy orders and sell orders within a narrow range around the current market price in a deep market the existence of many orders means that the price of the security is quickly brought to equilibrium as the demand and supply for that security changes in contrast shallow markets are characterised by shortages or oversupply resulting in discontinuity of buy and sell orders and large price jumps if supply exceeds demand the price of the security declines by a large amount that may cause material losses to holders of the security which may force them to postpone selling the security on the other hand if demand exceeds supply prices rise to such a degree that potential buyers may postpone the purchase of the security market width the market for a security is said to have width or broad if it is characterised by large transaction volumes in such markets not only prices are able to change continuously because of the existence of lots of orders as in a deep market but the order sizes above and below the current market price are also large as a result there is no incentive for buyers or sellers to postpone their decisions market makers are willing to accept smaller margins spread as the high turnover volume compensates for the small margins undesirable activities of the markets developed capital markets need proper regulations in place to prevent undesirable activities that distorts the efficiency of the market are i market cornering ii wash sales iii churning and iv pumpanddump market cornering this happens when a person buys all or most of the available quantities of a certain security to create a form of monopoly that may later enable him to sell the security at a higher price he is said to be cornering the market market regulation generally prohibits such activityinvestors handbook wash sales it means to create an illusion of trading activity for a given stock one form of wash sale is when a person sells a security to his son or a family member and then buys back the same security on the same day at either at higher price or lower price depending on the illusion that the person is intending to create the primary motive of such actions is to mislead the market in order to make unethical profits a deceptive investor could use this technique to artificially raise the price of a security by selling the stock at a high price and buying it back at a lower price on the same day encouraged by this false impression of false trading activity other investors enter the market as buyers resulting in a further rise in the securitys market price this allows the deceptive investor to sell his holdings at these artificially higher prices churning churning happens from a stocker brokers part it takes place when a broker engages in frequent and unnecessary trading on behalf of the client this is done by some unscrupulous brokers to generate increased income from trading commissions it is considered unethical and is an illegal activity pumpanddump pumpanddump is a scheme that attempts to boost the price of a stock through recommendations based on false misleading or greatly exaggerated statements the perpetrators of this scheme already have an established position in the companys stock and sell their positions after the hype has led to a higher share price this practice is illegal based on securities law and can lead to heavy fines financial market styles financial markets can operate on different basis or styles the major basis are i order driven and ii quote driven market order driven markets in an order driven market potential buyers and sellers of securities indicate how many securities they want to buy or sell and at what price the trading system brings buyers and sellers together where their requirements match most of the major stock markets around the world operate form of order driven trading system such as the new york stock exchange and the london stock exchange and nepal stock exchange ltd quote driven markets a small number of stock exchanges also operate under a quote driven style in a quote driven style the exchange enables financial institutions to act as market makers market makers are obliged to provide twoway quotes to buy and sell particular securities throughout the standard market hours in order to generate profit the market maker will quote a lower price to buy the securities the bid price and a higher price to sell the securities the investors handbook offer ask price the difference between the prices is often referred to as the bidoffer ask spread the key advantage that the quote driven system offers over the order driven system is the ability to trade throughout the trading day this is because the market makers are obliged to quote prices and be able to trade in at least a set minimum number of securities in an order driven market liquidity could dry up if there are no orders to buy or to sell the disadvantage of the quote driven system is that investors are effectively paying for the provision of liquidity through the bidoffer spread compared to the order driven system where the orders are matched principal and agency trading in both the order driven and quote driven market styles firms can act in two capacities i agent or ii principal a firm acting as agent simply arranges the trade on behalf of the client charging a commission firms acting as principal actually buy or sell securities themselves such as market makers in quote driven markets clearly firms taking principal positions take greater risks than those acting as in an agency capacity financial system in a simple a financial system allows the exchange of funds between different financial market participants like lenders investors and borrowers the systems operate at national and global levels and consisting of complex closely related services markets and institutions intended to provide an efficient and regular linkage between investors and depositors according to oecd a financial system consists of institutional units and markets

system is composed of the products and services provided by financial institutions which includes banks insurance companies pension funds organised exchanges and the many other companies that serve to

sebon regulates and oversee the securities markets in its designated jurisdictions to ensure an orderly development of the markets and protection of investors securities markets normally imply any exchange marketplace where financial assets and securities are traded so capital markets is a broader term in the sense that it includes trading of bonds derivatives and commodities as well as securities or stocks on the other hand sharestock markets can be taken as a category of capital markets where securitiesstocks are traded these two terms have been used interchangeably securities market development is essential for the economic development of a country the objective of economic activity in any country is to promote the wellbeing and standard of living of its people which depends upon the distribution of income in terms of goods and services in the economy for the growth process in the economy production plays a vital role production of output depends upon material inputs human inputs and financial inputs material inputs are in the form of raw materials plant and machinery etc human inputs are in the form of intellectual managerial and labour manpower financial inputs are in the shape of capital cash credit etc the proper availability and utilisation of these inputs promotes the economic development of a country the financial inputs among other sources emanate from the securities market system the securities market thrives with investors confidence based upon their return on investment as well as from anticipated capital appreciation from their investment investors are a heterogeneous group they comprise wealthy and middle class educated and illiterate young and old expert professional and nonprofessional and layman however all investors are in need protection not the protection for assured growth of their investments but protection from nongovernance malpractices and fraudulent most investors have three investment objectives i safety of the hardearned or saved invested money ii liquidity of the invested money and iii returns on the investments made securities markets regulators have to fulfil dual responsibilities by allowing to raise capital for economic development on one hand and to protect investors at large on the other hand however it is beyond debate that unless the interests of investors are investors handbook protected raising of capital would be difficult efficient securities markets should therefore provide a mechanism for efficient raising capital as well as have adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the general investors role of securities markets securities markets plays an extremely important role in promoting and sustaining the growth of an economy it is an important and efficient

securities market risk allocation would be fruitful investors handbook risk is an integrated part of the investment higher the potential of return higher is the risk associated with it examination of the risks involved in the securities market investment is one of the prime aspects of investing the element of risk is what distinguishes an investment from savings investment in stocks shares or bonds normally comes with the types of risks are i market risk ii industry risk iii business risk and iv regulatory risk market risk it is the overall risk involved in capital market investments the stock market rises and falls depending on a number of factors the collective view of the investors to invest in a particular stock or bond plays a significant role in the stock market rise and fall even if the company is going through a bad phase the stock price may go up due to a rising stock market while conversely the stock price may fall because the market is not steady even if the company is doing well industry risk it may arise from the market forces and regulations relating to a given industry thus all stocks within an industry would be affected by industry related factors regulatory

on the basis of rules and processes laid down by the exchange and regulator a commodity exchange is considered to be essentially public because anybody who wishes to transact must take the services of registered members investors handbook most of the trading in the commodity derivatives market is being done by people who have no need for the commodity itself they just speculate on the direction of the price of these commodities hoping to make money if the price moves in their favour the commodity derivatives market is a direct way to invest in commodities rather than investing in the companies that trade in those commodities products which are traded in commodity derivatives market include financial instruments namely forwards futures foreign currencies and indexes commodity derivatives which were traditionally developed for risk management purposes are now growing in popularity as an investment tool the forward contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell the underlying assets at a specific time in the future for a specified price determined today and futures is standardised forwards freely exchangeable on the market the historical role of forward and future contracts has been to hedge against inherent risks existing in commodity markets there is absence of equity derivative market however there is unregulated commodity derivative market in nepal commodity derivative markets can provide benefits to an economy by providing facilities for producers and consumers of commodities to protect themselves against the risk of price fluctuations commodity derivative market provides a vehicle through which the traders or participants can hedge their risks or protect themselves from the adverse price movements in the underlying assets in which they deal types of commodity markets commodity spot market a seller would deposit the commodity in its standardised units and receive payment for them when delivered to the buyer the buyer would pay on receipt of the commodity in question commodity futures market the buyer and seller would agree to a contract whereby the buyer would agree to buy and the seller to sell a standardised unit of the commodity for a price fixed in the contract at a future date once agreed between buyer and seller the contracts could then be traded again repeatedly between different market participants until such time as they become due for settlement physical delivery commodity futures marketa buyer of a commodity futures contract who holds the contract at the expiry date will receive the commodity in question and the seller receives cash cash settlement commodity future market the contract includes a reference price and on the date of settlement the reference price is compared with the price in the contract and one of the parties makes a cash payment to the other depending on whether the contract price exceeds or is less than the reference price investors handbook basis of nepalese commodity derivative market operation the exchanges provide facilities for the buyers and sellers of the contracts to see the best bid and offer price currently in the market each of the markets also has liquidity providers in the form of one or more market makers that deal in the commodities and provide bid and offer prices to customers buyers and sellers access the market through brokers who are licensed by the exchange and trade on the exchanges as agents for the clients trading is done by buying and selling contracts designed by the exchange each of the exchanges design their own contracts and the contracts for any one exchange are different from those in other exchanges each exchange has one or more clearing members a clearing member is responsible for making sure that a trade is settled the clearing member or members establish between themselves the overall net obligations of each of the clients of the brokers and make payments between themselves through a settlement bank to settle the accounts adoption of risk reduction mechanism once a trade is made the client through the broker must make a deposit known as initial margin of between percent of the nominal value of the commodity every day the value of the contract is assessed on the basis of movements in the underlying reference price if the value of the contract has declined during the day the client is required to pay via the broker to the clearing member an amount equivalent to the reduction in the value of the contract during the day if a client fails to make a variation margin payment clearing member will in principle close the contract by selling it on the exchange if the value of the contract has increased clearing member makes a payment to the client via the broker of the amount of the gain the

investment in securities requires considerable skill and expertise and carries the risk of loss if the choice of securities is not right or they are not boughtsold at right time so the choice of securities and timing of transaction matters a lot to succeed in the market there are a large variety of instruments referred to as securities in common parlance some instrument have that have both

nomination of the board of director for being a shareholder of the company share have different categories such as i commonordinary share ii preferential share preferential can be redeemable and nonredeemable shares are described as highrisk asset classes when compared with other types of investments the primary risk of investing in shares is that it can result in loss of capital bondsdebenture companies need money to undertake projects they then pay back using the money earned through the project one way of raising funds is through bonds when a company borrows from the bank in exchange for regular interest payments it is called a loan similarly when a company borrows from multiple investors in exchange for timely payments of interest it is called a bond in nepal one unit of bond par value is equivalent to rs public limited company can raise the capital by issuing the bond in nepal most of listed banks and few finance companies have issued the corporate bonds to the public issue of bond can be made by private placement as well as to the general public fixed interest is offered to the bond which is known as coupon interest thus a bond is a means of investing money by lending to others this is why it is called a debt instrument when you invest in bonds it will show the face investors handbook value the amount of money being borrowed the coupon rate or yield the interest rate that the borrower has to pay the coupon or interest payments and the deadline for paying the money back called as the maturity date if youre looking for a bond option that helps you save tax decision of issuance of bond depends on the cost of capital that a company assess to raise its fund bonds also trades in the secondary market in the context of nepal there is little transaction of bonds in the secondary market development of bond market is very essential for the development of the securities markets investment in the bond or debenture is relatively safe because return in it is fixed so it is also called fixed income instrument bond and debenture sounds like the same and has been used interchangeably though there is a slight difference between these two terms normally debentures are issued and purchased only on the creditworthiness and reputation of the company or issuing company it is not secured by any sort of the physical assets or collateral bonds are normally backed by the asset of the issuer so the debenture is considered to be slightly risker than the bond often pushing the interest coupon rate comparatively higher than of bond categories of bond bond can be of different types such as i a bond with out specified maturity period is perpetual bond ii a bond without any coupon interest and sold at substantial discount is zero coupon bond iii a bond with specified coupon interest with a finite maturity is a regular bond iv a bond selling at below its par value is discount bond and v a bond setting at above its par value is premium bond in the nepalese securities markets the many corporates such as commercial banks and some finance companies particularly listed companies have issued debenture with fixed maturity periods on the other hand nepal government have been issued bonds debenture issued by the listed companies have been traded in the secondary market government bonds has not organised trading platform yet the risk faced by investors in bond an investor who purchases bonds faces risks from a variety of sources such as i inflation risk ii default risk iii liquidity risk and iv interest rate risk interest rate risk it is also called price risk the market price of a bond is inversely proportional to the level of interest rates when interest rates fall bond prices increase and conversely when interest rates rise bond prices decrease as interest rates fluctuate randomly in the economy the bond will experience random price movements this random variation in price is termed price risk bond investors therefore experience price gains when interest rates fall and suffer price losses when interest rates rise inflation risk it is related to the concept of interest rate risk discussed above as inflation investors handbook increases so do interest rates which then affects bond prices while most financial assets are influenced by inflation bonds are affected most severely liquidity risk a liquid security market is where an investor is able to sell a security at short notice without having to offer a substantial price discount a market for securities that are actively traded tend to be liquid bond markets especially corporate bond markets tend to be thin with infrequent trading bondholders wishing to sell in such markets may have to offer a price discount and therefore suffer a loss to attract buyers default risk it is risk when a corporation that borrows funds by issuing bonds is unable to make the promised interest and principal payments the bond is said to be in default the likelihood that a bondholder may lose his money through such nonpayment is termed default risk while government bonds do not suffer from this problem because they can ultimately increase taxes or simply print money to repay the bonds all corporate bonds have some amount of default risk albeit in varying degrees assessing the likelihood of default is not an easy task as it requires a thorough analysis of the financial performance of the borrowing company credit rating of company and bond is very important to know the risk factor in such case mutual funds these are investment vehicles that allow you to indirectly investing in share or bonds it pools money from a collection of investors and then invests that sum in financial instruments available this is handled by a professional fund manager on the result of rigorous research therefore thought to be safer investment every mutual fund scheme issues units which have a certain value just like a share when you invest you thus become a unitholder when the instruments that the mf scheme invests in make money as a unitholder you get money in nepal one unit is equivalent to rs this is either through a rise in the value of the units or through the distribution of dividendsmoney to all unitholders there are normally two types of mutual fund in term of its life they are closeended and openended closeended mutual funds have fixed maturity period and openend mutual funds have generally no maturity period derivatives the value of financial instruments like shares keeps on changing so it is difficult to fix a particular price derivatives instruments come handy in such case these are instruments that help you trade in the future at a price that you fix today simply put you enter into an agreement to either buy or sell a share or other instrument at a certain fixed price in nature hybrid instruments some instrument have that have both the features of money markets and capital markets are i warrants ii dual currency bonds iii exchangeable investors handbook debt iv equitylinked notes and v convertible debentures etc these are called hybrid instruments specialised investment fund sif a specialized investment fund sif is a fund dedicated to well informed and qualified investors offering adaptability and risk protection a sif may invest in all asset classes and follow any type of investment strategy but a fund is always subject to risk and diversification requirements the primary objective of a sif is the collective investment of the funds raised from its investors while applying the principle of risk diversification the most common fund under sif are i private equity pe ii venture capital vc and iii hedge fund hf private equity pe private equity pe is ownership of or an interest in an entity that is not publicly traded often it is high net worth individuals andor firms that purchase shares of privatelyheld companies or acquire control of publiclytraded companies and possibly take a public company private the aim is to invest in companies that have growth potential and then use the private equity investment to turnaround or expand the business the company can then be sold for a profit private equity firms also known as private equity funds offer investment opportunities to a limited number of accredited investors limited partners who are better able to understand httpslimestoneeufundplatforms specialisedinvestmentfundand financially handle the risks of such investments these limited partners often consist of university endowment funds pension funds wealthy people and other companies private equity firms typically serve as the general partner venture capital vc venture capital vc is an important source of funding for new businesses eg startups that do not have access to other sources such as business loans from banks or capital markets but do have potential for longterm growth although these investments often involve high risk they can also offer aboveaverage returns the vc investors often negotiate to obtain equity ownership representation on the companys board of directors andor an active role in managing the companys operations hedge funds hf hedge funds hf are a type of investment partnership where a number of investors ie the limited partners pool their funds together to be invested by a professional fund manager ie the general partner according to the funds investment strategy which may be innovative or otherwise nontraditional when compared to more familiar investment options while structurally similar to a mutual fund hfs generally invest more aggressively and are limited to qualified investors ie those who meet certain net worth requirements making them better able to tolerate the increased investment risk compared to the heavily regulated investors handbook mutual funds hfs operate with a wide degree of investment latitude and are often leveraged to maximise their returns hfs differ from private equity pe firms in that hfs usually focus on short or medium term liquid securities that are more quickly convertible to cash hfs also do not have direct control over the business or asset in which they are investing by contrast pe firms are geared toward longerterm investment strategies in illiquid assets where they have more control or influence over operations to influence the longterm returns the specialised investment fund regulations has explanation of these funds private equity fund means a fund injecting initial equity or other instruments related to equity or making investments as per the desire of partner of a company venture capital fund means the funds whose securities are the initial phase of operation and not listed with stock exchange market or a fund in the business related to innovative knowledge skills or competency or new goods services technology or intellectual property hedge fund means a fund established to make investments in any sectors with high risks however the existing

investment fund regulagions rule cspecialised investment fund regulagions investors handbook chapter investment planning process investment is important because one needs to invest to maximise returns on ones savings appreciate ones assets and also to be able to generate cash flows for meeting several financial needs of the future one must however invest with knowledge and full care in order to not only protect ones hardearned capital but also generate good returns therefore investors need to invest in systemic way or making and following an investment plan investment planning is a planned process of matching ones financial goals and objectives with ones financial resources it is a part of financial planning determining steps to investing before making any investment decision assurance of the following points are must obtain written documents explaining the investment read and understand such documents verify the legitimacy and validity of the investment find out the costs and benefits associated with the investment assess riskreturn profile of the investment know the liquidity and safety aspects of the investment ascertain if the product is appropriate for your specific goals compare the product with other investments opportunities available examine if it fits with other investments you are considering or you have already made deal only through registered intermediaries seek all clarifications about the intermediary and the investment explore the options available to you should something go wrong and then if satisfied make the investment importance of investment one needs to invest to maximise returns on ones savings and also to be able to generate cash flows for meeting several financial needs of the future one must invest with knowledge and full care in order to not only protect ones hardearned capital but also generate good returns investment objectives there are normally three objectives such as i safety ii return and iii liquidity this means that one would like an investment to be absolutely safe while it generates handsome returns and provides high liquidity however it is difficult to maximise all three objectives simultaneously typically one objective tradesoff against another for example if one wants high returns one may have to take some risks or if one wants high liquidity one may have to compromise on returns for people who have a regular income growthoriented investments with some risks are idealinvestors handbook specification of the financial goals investments are made with certain financial objectives these objectives should be defined clearly and be measurable in money terms for example it is not enough to say i want to retire comfortably such an objective should be stated as i want to retire with the ability to spend rs annually adjusted for inflation an investor saves today to meet certain financial needs tomorrow unless the investor is clear about the purpose of saving his efforts would not result in the desired benefits an investor should therefore first identify his financial needs for example an investor may have one or more of the following financial needs to retire at age with an annual income of rs i am now years of age to completely payoff the housing loan by the time i retire years later to pay for my daughters college education that would cost me rs per year for years the first step for an investor is to clearly write down the financial needs the financial needs would be expressed in terms of the amount required and the future date on which required in the above three examples we would write example amount required when required number rs pa each year beginning from the th year from now rs pm for the next years rs pa beginning from th year from now till th year every investor should take out time and prepare such a statement of financial goals covering as many requirements as possible this is the basis on which the financial plan would be prepared if the financial capability is found to be inadequate to meet all these goals then they have to be prioritised the investors financial needs depend on the age stage in the career path size of the family needs of the other family members etc some of the needs can be identified with precision while others can only be tentatively determined there may be unanticipated needs as well for which provisions have to be made sometimes financial needs change with investors changing circumstances in order to prepare a financial plan these goals have to be stated in clear and determinable terms of age amounts and time frame the financial planning process is merely an exercise of allocation of todays money to meet tomorrows needs the financial plan is not static it has to be reviewed from time to time to account for the changing circumstances assessing the financial capacity an investor sets aside some money today to realise the financial goals stated in the financial plan how much money can be set aside now depends investors handbook on the present circumstances this can be understood by understanding the income assets and liabilities of the individual investor the balance sheet lists the investors assets and liabilities hopefully the assets exceed the liabilities and this excess is the net worth all assets and liabilities should be valued at the current market value instead of any cost basis for example if you own an equity share bought at rs and it is worth rs now your balance sheet should reflect rs an investor should live within his means means is the income out of this income routine expenses are met the remaining amount is available for savings an investor should prepare a statement of income and expense it is called cash flow statement the sources of income are salary dividends interest selfemployment earnings etc after identifying the income an investor should identify the expenses expenses are generally grouped into living expenses payments already committed and taxes the excess of income over expenses in each year is the amount available to save the investor tries to achieve his financial goals subject to his saving capacity the cash flow statement is prepared under different scenarios these are death disability and retirement investment process as investors we would all like to beat the market and we would all like to pick great investments on instinct however while intuition is undoubtedly a part of the process of investing it is just part of the process as investors it is not surprising that we focus so much of our energy and efforts on investment philosophies and strategies and so little on the investment process it is far more interesting to read about how peter lynch picks stocks and what makes warren buffett a valuable investor than it is to talk about the steps involved in creating a portfolio or in executing trades though it does not get sufficient attention understanding the investment process is critical for every investor for several reasons the investment process outlines the steps in creating a portfolio and emphasises the sequence of actions involved from understanding the investors risk preferences to asset allocation and selection to performance evaluation by emphasising the sequence it provides for an orderly way in which an investor can create his or her own portfolio or a portfolio for someone else the investment process provides a structure that allows investors to see the source of different investment strategies and philosophies by doing so it allows investors to take the hundreds of strategies that they see described in the common press and in investment newsletters and to trace them to their common roots the investment process emphasises the different components that are needed for an investment strategy to be successful and by so doing explain why so many strategies that look good investors handbook on paper never work for those who use them investing well has a secret formula having the right information planning and making good choices level and management of risk different securities carry different riskreturn profiles generally higher risks carry higher returns and viceversa the risk could be in the form of credit risk counter party may default payment as it may not have integrity return risk the return from the investment may depend on several contingent factors and liquidity risk it may be difficult to convert security into cash investment decisions are based upon the investors life cycle stages and other factors such as liquidity safety return on investments tax savings active involvement required to manage the investment and minimum amount requirement for selecting the instruments it is not always possible to meet all financial goals with available savings if savings are limited but the needs are substantial then the savings should be invested in avenues that would offer high returns but usually high return also means high risk all investors are not in a position to take high risks there are investment opportunities that are high on risk and there are investment opportunities that are low on risk each is called an asset class an investor allocates his savings to one or more asset classes depending upon his circumstances this decision is called the asset allocation decision asset allocation decision is perhaps the most important decision in the investment process the essence of asset allocation lies in the fact that over time it can determine up to percent of the portfolios return how much risk an investor can take depends on his financial circumstances and the mental makeup every investor must know his own unique risk profile and then make the investment decisions factors determining the types of investor are i preparedness to take high risks and ii averse opposed to taking risks there are scientific methods by which an investor can understand hisher risk profile for example answering the following set of questions could give an idea about hisher risk profile age groups between between between above your position is best described by you are selfdependent and do not support anybody you have dependents nearing towards retirement already retired how much of the following needs have been taken care of fully partially not at all insurance retirement childrens education housinginvestors handbook medical what proportion of your current expenses is funded from investments nil up to between and between and more than future earnings far exceed inflation be marginally ahead of inflation keep pace with inflation not keep pace with inflation when the price of the share you have purchased drops steeply you would sell your investment sell part of your investment do nothing buy more of the same investment each of the above questions would impact the risk profile of an investor for example lower the age greater is the expected willingness to take risks this is because younger people have a lifetime of earnings ahead of them and thus can afford to take higher risks with their present savings similarly in case a person does not have any dependents he can take more risk at the very basic level there are three asset classes from which to choose from based upon an investors risk profile they are equity debt and cash equity is risky debt has low risk and cash has even lower risk within each of the above asset classes the investor has to select specific instruments for investmentfinancial circumstances and the investor profile dictate the investment avenues for an investor financial instruments vary in terms of the liquidity safety and returns they offer the challenge in making the investment decision is to choose the right combination of instruments keeping in mind the financial situation and investor profile each investment option has some advantages and some limitations for example while bank savings account would be highly liquid you can withdraw whenever you like investment in public provident fund would be difficult to withdraw risks are generally positively correlated with probability of returns for example returns in equity shares can be high but the associated risks are also relatively higher than other options risks can be classified into unsystematic and systematic unsystematic risks are those that can be minimised by diversifying ones portfolio for example instead of investing in the shares of steel companies alone one could invest into other sectors like pharmaceuticals and software in this situation your portfolio may not be terribly affected even if the steel sector were to register a mediocre performance on the other hand systematic risks are those that cannot be minimised through portfolio diversification for example a korean investor could not possibly have minimised or eliminated his loss due to the currency crisis in south east asia through a strategy of diversification of his portfolio the character of the investor is also important some investors have the investors handbook time and the knowledge to study their investment portfolios carefully these could be called as active investors others do not intend to watch their investments regularly due to lack of time or knowledge or inclination and are looking for essentially safer avenues for parking their funds process of investment as investors we

securities before taking a decision to invest is considered to be an important step market indexindices market index is a yardstick of performance of the stock markets market indices are computed to provide an indication of the overall performance of the stock market or specific segments of the market the dow jones industrial average djia for instance is an average of the largest stocks in the us while the dow jones transportation index is an average for only the stocks of transportation companies technically an average can be constructed by using different weighting schemes price weighting value weighting or equal weighting the distinctions between these three methods of construction will be considered in more detail in the next section the purpose of indices is to provide a barometer of the performance of the overall stock market at a given point in time some stocks may be advancing while others may be declining the index is the average that provides the general direction of the market the mutual fund industry uses these indices as benchmarks to assess the performance of particular funds and fund managers the following table highlights the characteristics of some of well

stock with a higher price will have a greater influence on the average in a value weighted it is a scheme the stock of a company with a larger value measured by market capitalisation price per share times the number of shares outstanding will have a greater influence on the average an equal weighting it is a scheme as the name implies assigns the same importance to every stock comprising the average the dow jones industrial average djia is an example of a price weighted index while the sp index in the us and the tasi tadawul all shares index in saudi arabia are examples of value weighted indices the dow jones industrial average djia is the oldest and most widely known index representing the largest and most significant stocks in the us economy originally the index was computed by dividing the sum of the stock prices by however over time the weights have been altered to reflect stock splits stock dividends and new stocks replacing older ones the implied weight for this index is determined by the share price and it is therefore a price weighted index a stock market index should capture the behaviour of the overall equity market movements of the index should represent the returns obtained by typical portfolios in the country the ups and downs of an index reflect the changing expectations of the stock market about future dividends of nepals corporate sector when the index goes up it is because the stock market thinks that the prospective dividends in the future will be better than previously thought when prospects of dividends in the future become pessimistic the index drops the ideal index gives us instanttoinstant readings about how the stock market perceives the future of particular countrys corporate sector calculation of nepse index by multiplying the ratio of current periods total market capitalisation to base periods total market capitalisation by we get the nepse index this method of index calculation is called value weighted method thus nepse

information has been disclosed incorrectly he can notify sebon about the same is grading optional ipo grading is mandatory any issuer who wishes to offer shares through an ipo is required to obtain a grade for his ipo who is authorised to award the ipo grades ipo grades are awarded by the sebon registered cras what are the factors that are evaluated by the cra to assess the fundamentals of the ipo while arriving at the grade the ipo grading process is expected to take into account the prospects of the industry in which the company operates the competitive strengths of the company that would allow it to address the risks inherent in its business and capitalise on the opportunities available as well as the companys financial position while the actual factors considered for grading may not be identical or limited to the following the areas listed below are generally looked into by the cras while arriving at an ipo grade business prospects and competitive position a industry prospectsb company prospects financial position management quality corporate governance practices compliance and litigation history new projectsrisks and prospects does ipo grading consider the price at which the shares will be offered in the ipo no ipo grading is done without taking into account the price at which the security will be offered in the ipo since ipo grading does not consider the issue price the investor needs to make an independent judgment regarding the price at which to bid for the shares offered through the ipo irrespective of the ipo grade does an ipo grade which indicates above average or strong fundamentals mean high safety an ipo grade is not a suggestion or recommendation as to whether one should subscribe to the ipo or not ipo grade needs to be read together with the disclosures made in the prospectus including the risk factors as well as the price at which the shares are offered in the issueinvestors handbook empirical data now clearly shows that a high graded ipo may not provide positive returns and vice versa at what stage is an issue required to obtain the ipo grade ipo grading can be obtained either before filing the draft offer documents with sebo or thereafter however the prospectus must contain the grade given to the ipo can the issuer reject an ipo grade ipo grades cannot be rejected irrespective of whether the issuer finds the grade given by the cra acceptable or not the grade has to be disclosed in the offer documentissue advertisements however the issuer has the option of approaching another cra in such an event too all grades obtained for the ipo will have to be disclosed what is the roll of sebon in the ipo grading exercise sebon does not play any role in the assessment made by the cra the grading is intended to be an independent opinion of the cras licensed by sebon who bears the cost of the ipo grading process the company making the ipo or issuing shares is required to bear the expenses incurred for grading its ipo what is

basis of the bids obtained the regulation is under the drafting process book building is a process of price discovery the applicants bid for the shares quoting the price and the quantity that they would like to bid at the bids have to be made within the price band specified by the issuer lower price is known as floor price and higher price is known as cap within the price band retail investors also have the option of not bidding at a particular price but rather using the cutoff option after the bidding process is complete the cutoff price ie the final issue price is arrived at by the issuer depending upon the bids received at various prices though an issuer can stipulate the final price to be any price including the highest price of the price band in case the entire quantity of shares proposed to be sold are bid for at that price he can also choose any lower price point within the band all applicants who have bid at or above the cut off price are then eligible for allotment and are allotted shares at the same cut off price even if they had bid at a higher price dutch auction process the basis of allotment is then finalised and allotmentrefund is undertaken what is systematic risk systematic risk is most simply defined as the inherent risk an investor takes by having money invested into a specific asset class it is a risk that can be managed through strategies like asset allocation and diversification but the only way that it can be eliminated entirely is to not be invested in the market put another way systematic risk is the opportunity cost associated with choosing one type of investment over another the investing mantra stocks beat bonds bonds beat cash reflects the concept of systematic risk and associated reward there is potentially a higher reward for investing in stocks but also a higher opportunity cost systematic risk in the market deals with macroeconomic or general economic factors these include things like interest rates inflation and unemployment macroeconomic features look at the economy as a whole as opposed to a specific industry such as technology stocks or utility stocks like many things the best way to understand systematic risk is to understand unsystematic risk unsystematic risk is related to a specific asset class or even a group of securities within an asset class for example there are times when a specific stock

diversification investment horizon regularity of income growth opportunities the quality of the issuer etc vii one can convert a security to cash if it is listed and traded actively on stock exchanges

one does not get cash for whatsoever reason there is an institutional arrangement to settle the claims however all securities are not listed on exchanges and not all listed securities are actively traded if liquidity is of paramount importance one should look at the history of trading of that particular security viii it is advisable to trade only through a stock exchange stock exchange lists securities and provides investors an opportunity to trade in the listed securities it ensures certain compliances and disclosures from companies in the investors interest it guarantees settlement of trades executed on behalf of the investors and provides the protection if the broker becomes a defaulter any trade in securities outside stock exchanges other than spot transactions is not backed by

ensures liquidity to the investors moreover when one deals through an exchange the investor gets the best price prevailing at that time for the trade and the right to receive the money or securities on time the other benefit of trading on an exchange is that an investor does not have to take any counterparty risk which is assumed by a clearing corporation if an investor were to deal buy or sell directly with another person he is exposed to the counter party risk ie the risk of nonperformance by that party however when one deals through a stock exchange this counter party risk is removed due

more faq faq derivative markets what is a derivative derivatives are financial contracts which derive their value from movements in the spot price of an underlying asset for example wheat farmers may wish investors handbook to enter into a contract to sell their harvest at a future date to eliminate the risk of a change in prices by that date such a transaction would take place through a forward or futures market this market is the derivatives market and the prices of this market would be driven by the spot market price of wheat which is the underlying the term contracts is often applied to denote the specific traded instrument whether it is a derivative contract in wheat gold or equity shares the world over derivatives are a key part of the financial system the most important contract types are futures and options and the most important underlying markets are equity treasury bills commodities foreign exchange real estate etc the term derivative indicates that it has no independent value ie its value is entirely derived from the value of the underlying asset the underlying asset can be securities commodities bullion currency live stock or anything else in other words derivative means a forward future option or any other hybrid contract of pre determined fixed duration linked for the purpose of contract fulfillment to the value of a specified real or financial asset or to an index of securities the term derivative has been defined in securities contracts regulations act as a a security derived from a debt instrument share loan whether secured or unsecured risk instrument or contract for differences or any other form of security b a contract which derives its value from the prices or index of prices of underlying securities how are derivatives categorised derivatives are usually broadly categorised by the relationship between the underlying and the derivative eg forward option swap type of underlying eg equity derivatives foreign exchange derivatives interest rate derivatives commodity derivatives or credit derivatives market in which they trade eg exchange traded or overthecounter payoff profile some derivatives have nonlinear payoff diagrams due to embedded optionality there is no definitive rule for distinguishing one from the other so the distinction is mostly a matter of custom why should an investor use derivatives derivatives a re used by investors to provide leverage or gearing such that a small movement in the underlying value can cause a large difference in the value of the derivative since the investor is required to pay a small fraction of the value of the total contract as margin trading in futures is a leveraged activity since the investors handbook investor is able to control the total value of the contract with a relatively small amount of margin thus the leverage enables the investors to make a larger profit or loss with a comparatively small amount of capital speculate and to make a profit if the value of the underlying asset moves the way they expect eg moves in a given direction stays in or out of a specified range reaches a certain level hedge or mitigate risk in the underlying by entering into a derivative contract whose value moves in the opposite direction to their underlying position and cancels part or all of it out obtain exposure to underlying where it is not possible to trade in the underlying eg weather derivatives create optionality where the value of the derivative is linked to a specific condition or event eg the underlying reaching a specific price level what are the benefits of investing in derivatives derivatives facilitate the buying and selling of risk and many people consider this to have a positive impact on the economic system although someone loses money while someone else gains money with a derivative under normal circumstances trading in derivatives should not adversely affect the economic system because it is not zero sums in utilitywhat are the downsides of derivatives a major disadvantage of derivatives is the risk of losing money while derivatives help increase profits and reduce risks they may also make an investor lose out on a lot of money or other assets for example a cotton farmer enters into a contract with a weaver the cotton producer may agree on a fixed price to sell the cotton to the weaver on harvest time this ensures a fixed income and a sure customer for the cotton farmer on the other hand the weaver is also ensured of a supply of cotton this agreement could be a disadvantage when the price of cotton fluctuates if the price of cotton goes up the farmer would still have to sell the cotton at the earlier agreed cost this makes the farmer lose out on the profit price fluctuations on the cotton could affect the weaver too if the price of cotton goes down he still has to pay the high cost that was agreed in the contract regardless of the decrease in cottons price or value investors must understand that investment in derivatives has an element of risk and is generally not an appropriate avenue for someone of limited resources limited investment andor trading experience and low risk tolerance an investor should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for him or her in the light of his or her financial condition an investor must accept that there can be no guarantee of profits or no exception from losses while executing orders for purchase and or sale of derivative contracts investors who trade in derivatives at the exchange are advised to carefully read investors handbook the model risk disclosure document and the details contained therein this document is given by the broker to his clients and must be read the implications understood and signed by the investor the document clearly states the risks associated with trading in derivatives and advises investors to bear utmost caution before entering into the markets what is hedging hedging is a technique that attempts to reduce risk it helps in reducing the risk associated with exposures in underlying market by taking a counter positions in the futures market for example an investor who has purchased a portfolio of stocks may have a fear of adverse market conditions in future which may reduce the value of his portfolio he can hedge against this risk by shorting the index which is correlated with his portfolio say the nifty or the bse sensex in case the markets fall he would make a profit by squaring off his short nifty bse sensex position this profit would compensate for the loss he suffers in his portfolio as a result of the fall in the markets hedging can be done by using derivatives derivatives allow transferring the risk associated with the underlying asset from one party to another for example a wheat farmer and a miller could sign a futures contract to exchange a specified amount of cash for a specified amount of wheat in the future both parties have reduced a future risk for the wheat farmer the uncertainty of the price and for the miller the availability of wheat however there is still the risk that no wheat will be available because of events unspecified by the contract like the weather or that one party will renege on the contract although a third party called a clearing house insures a futures contract not all derivatives are insured against counterparty risk what is a forward contract in a forward contract two parties agree to do a trade at some future date at a stated price and quantity no money changes hands at the time the deal is signed why is forward contracting useful forward contracting is very valuable in hedging and speculation the classic hedging application would be that of a wheat farmer forward selling his harvest at a known price in order to eliminate price risk conversely a bread factory may want to buy bread forward in order to assist production planning without the risk of price fluctuations if a speculator has information or analysis which forecasts an upturn in price then he can go long on the forward market instead of the cash market the speculator would go long on the forward wait for the price to rise and then take a reversing transaction making a profit what are the problems of forward markets forward markets worldwide are afflicted by several problems a lack of centralisation of trading b illiquidity and c counterparty riskinvestors handbook the forward market is like the real estate market in that any two persons can form contracts against each other this often makes them design terms of the deal which are very convenient in that specific situation for the specific parties but makes the contracts nontradeable if more participants are involved also the phone market here is unlike the centralisation of price discovery that is obtained on an exchange resulting in an illiquid market place for forward markets counterparty risk in forward markets is a simple idea when one of the two sides of the transaction chooses to declare bankruptcy the other suffers forward markets have one basic issue the larger the time period over which the forward contract is open the larger are the potential price movements and hence the larger is the counter party risk even when forward markets trade standardised contracts and hence avoid the problem of illiquidity the counterparty risk remains a very real problem what is a futures contract a futures contract is a legally binding agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future at a certain price future contracts are organisedstandardised contracts in terms of quantity quality in case of commodities delivery time and place for settlement on any date in future the contract expires on a prespecified date which is called the expiry date of the contract on expiry futures can be settled by delivery of the underlying asset or cash cash settlement enables the settlements of obligations arising out of the futureoption contract in cash what is the difference between futures and forward contracts futures markets were designed to solve all the three problems of forward markets futures markets are exactly like forward markets in terms of basic economics however contracts are standardised and trading is centralised on a stock exchange there is no counterparty risk thanks to the institution of a clearing corporation which becomes counterparty to both sides of each transaction and guarantees the trade in futures markets unlike in forward markets increasing the time to expiration does not increase the counter party risk futures markets are highly liquid as compared to the forward markets what is an option contract option contract is a type of derivatives contract which gives the right but not an obligation to buy or sell the underlying at a stated date and at a stated price the buyerholder of the option purchases the right from the sellerwriter for a consideration which is called the premium while a buyerholder of an option pays the premium and buys the right to exercise his option the sellerwriter of an option is the one who receives the option premium and is therefore obliged to sellbuy the asset if the buyer exercises it on him the underlying asset could include securities an index of prices of securities etc investors handbook options are of two types call and put options calls give the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy a given quantity of the underlying asset at a given price on or before a given future date puts give the buyer the right but not the obligation to sell a given quantity of underlying asset at a given price on or before a given future date further options are classified based on when they can be exercised the two most popular types are european or american american options are options contracts that can be exercised at any time upto the expiration date this request for exercise is submitted to the exchange which randomly assigns the exercise request to the sellers of the options who are obligated to settle the terms of the contract within a specified time frame european options are options that can be exercised only on the expiration date the price at which the option is to be exercised is called strike price or exercise price as in the case of futures contracts option contracts can also be settled by delivery of the underlying asset or cash however unlike futures cash settlement in an option contract entails payingreceiving the difference between the strike priceexercise price and the spot price of the underlying asset either at the time of expiry of the contract or at the time of exercise assignment of the option contract what are index future and index option contracts futures contract based on an index ie the underlying asset is the index are known as index futures contracts for instance futures contracts on nifty index and bse index these contracts derive their value from the value of the underlying index similarly option contracts which are based on some index are known as index options contracts however unlike index futures the buyer of index option contracts has only the right but not the obligation to buy sell the underlying index on expiry index option contracts are generally european style options an index in turn derives its value from the prices of securities that constitute the index and is created to represent the sentiments of the market as a whole or of a particular sector of the economy indices that represent the whole market are broad based indices and those that represent a particular sector are sectoral indices what are the benefits of trading in index futures compared to any other security an investor can trade the entire stock market by buying index futures instead of buying individual securities with the efficiency of a mutual fund the advantages of trading in index futures areinvestors handbook the contracts are highly liquid index futures provide higher leverage than any other stocks it requires low initial capital requirement it has lower risk than buying and holding stocks it is just as easy to trade the short side as the long side only have to study one index instead of s of stocks what is a mini derivative contract the lower minimum contract size means that smaller investors are able to hedge their portfolio using these contracts with a lower capital outlay this means a better hedge for portfolio and also results in more liquidity in the market why longer dated index options longer dated derivatives products are useful for those investors who want to have a long term hedge or long term exposure in derivative market the premiums for longer term derivatives products are higher than for standard options in the same stock because the increased expiration date gives the underlying asset more time to make a substantial move and for the investor to make a healthy profit what is the expiration day it is the last day on which the contracts expire futures and options contracts expire on the last thursday of the expiry month if the last thursday is a trading holiday the contracts expire on the previous trading day for eg the january contracts mature on january what are currency futures currency futures are contracts to buy or sell a specific underlying currency at a specific time in the future for a specific price currency futures are exchangetraded contracts and they are standardised in terms of delivery date amount and contract terms currency future contracts allow investors to hedge against foreign exchange risk since these contracts are markedto market daily investors canby closing out their positionexit from their obligation to buy or sell the currency prior to the contracts delivery

the closing price of a stock for the last trading days and divide it by for a standard moving average all values are weighted equally shortselling an investor sells short when he anticipates that the price of a stock may fall from the existing price so the investor borrows a share and sells it once the share price dips he will buy the same share at a lower price and return it back while pocketing

investment a large standard deviation means that there is a greater variance between its price and the mean indicating a wider price range calculating the standard deviation requires finding the mean

trading programmes will calculate the standard deviation for you relative strength index rsi this is a simple calculation that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to track momentum that may indicate when stocks are overbought or oversold the calculation of the relative strength index is as follows rsi rs rs relative strength the average gain of up periods during the time frame being

overbought condition an rsi of or below usually indicates an oversold condition technical analysis it is the study of chart patterns and statistical figures to understand market trends and pick stocks accordingly one day the share price is up another day it may be down but over time if you look at the stock prices movement you may see trends and patterns emerge the study of these chart patterns and trends in stock prices is called technical analysis of stocks when you learn technical analysis of stocks you will understand the big role that technical indicators play technical analysis has stood in premises of assumption that the history repeats fundamentals of technical analysis are i market prices reflect all the information about a stock ii patterns tend to repeat and iii stock prices follow trends technical analysis is useful before entering to the securities market the bottom line on technical analysis the allure of technical analysis is that there are great gains that can be made if only you know how to accurately interpret the price movement of different stocks but investors should take caution that they are not using technical analysis merely to support their own assumptions in this way its a lot like fundamental analysis both investors handbook methods require investors to allow the facts to inform their trading technical analysis is not for everyone but if you are the kind of investor that has enough time enough restraint and enough trust in statistics there can be a lot of satisfaction in accurately predicting price movements however as much as we would like to believe otherwise nobody can predict the market with certainty all the time human behavior gets in the way of even the most accurate technical predictions technical analysis allows
