The full-fledged dematerialised transaction of securities, the introduction of ASBA, C-ASBA and Meroshare system in the primary market enabling the applicants from 77 districts to access the service through more than 2500 BFIs as service providers, branch expansion of merchant bankers and stockbrokers outside of Kathmandu valley and adoption of on-line trading system have made Nepalese securities markets techno-friendly, investment friendly and countrywide resulting increased attraction of public towards the securities markets in recent days.\n",

      "investors in the markets, lack of diversified instruments and low level of understanding and awareness in securities markets continues to be a cause of concern. Investors and even students tend to use thumb rules or seek advice from friends, market intermediaries and relatives, which are often poor approximations compared to those that follow from a scientific analysis. They will tend to make bad choices, contribute insufficiently, begin saving late, stay away from modern finance, or fall prey to fraud or mis-selling of financial instruments. If they get bad advice, the outcomes will be poor, and they will lose faith in the market system. \n",

The purpose of the handbook is to provide the basics of securities markets and commodity derivatives markets to the students of Schools and Colleges at early age and investors at large to enable enhancing their understanding and making informed investment decisions of their hard-earned incomes and savings.\n",
